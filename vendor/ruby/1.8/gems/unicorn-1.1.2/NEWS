=== 1.1.2 / 2010-07-13 20:04 UTC

  This release is fixes a long-standing bug where the original PID
  file is not restored when rolling back from a USR2 upgrade.
  Presumably most upgrades aren't rolled back, so it took over a
  year to notice this issue.  Thanks to Lawrence Pit for
  discovering and reporting this issue.

=== 1.0.1 / 2010-07-13 20:01 UTC

  The first maintenance release of 1.0.x, this release is
  primarily to fix a long-standing bug where the original PID file
  is not restored when rolling back from a USR2 upgrade.
  Presumably most upgrades aren't rolled back, so it took over a
  year to notice this issue.  Thanks to Lawrence Pit for
  discovering and reporting this issue.

  There is also a pedantic TeeInput bugfix which shouldn't affect
  real apps from the 1.1.x series and a test case fix for OSX,
  too.

=== 1.1.1 / 2010-07-11 02:13 UTC

  Unicorn::TeeInput constant resolution for Unicorn::ClientError
  got broken simplifying code for RDoc.  This affects users
  of Rainbows! and Zbatery.

=== 1.1.0 / 2010-07-08 07:57 UTC

  This is a small, incremental feature release with some internal
  changes to better support upcoming versions of the Rainbows! and
  Zbatery web servers.  There is no need to upgrade if you're
  happy with 1.0.0, but also little danger in upgrading.

  There is one pedantic bugfix which shouldn't affect anyone
  and small documentation updates as well.

=== 1.0.0 / 2010-06-17 09:18 UTC

  There are only minor changes since 0.991.0.

  For users clinging onto the past, MRI 1.8.6 support has been
  restored.  Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the
  latest 1.8.7, REE or 1.9.1.

  For users looking towards the future, the core test suite and
  the Rails 3 (beta) integration tests pass entirely under 1.9.2
  preview3.  As of the latest rubinius.git[1], Rubinius support is
  nearly complete as well.

  Under Rubinius, signals may corrupt responses as they're being
  written to the socket, but that should be fixable transparently
  to us[4].  Support for the hardly used, hardly documented[2]
  embedded command-line switches in rackup config (.ru) files is
  is also broken under Rubinius.

  The recently-released Rack 1.2.1 introduced no compatiblity
  issues[3] in core Unicorn.  We remain compatible with all Rack
  releases starting with 0.9.1 (and possibly before).

  [1] tested with Rubinius upstream commit
  cf4a5a759234faa3f7d8a92d68fa89d8c5048f72
  [2] lets avoid the Dueling Banjos effect here :x
  [3] actually, Rack 1.2.1 is broken under 1.8.6.

=== 0.991.0 / 2010-06-11 02:18 UTC

  The "working_directory" configuration parameter is now handled
  before config.ru.  That means "unicorn" and "unicorn_rails" no
  longer barfs when initially started outside of the configured
  "working_directory" where a config.ru is required.  A huge
  thanks to Pierre Baillet for catching this ugly UI inconsistency
  before the big 1.0 release

  Thanks to Hongli Lai, out-of-the-box Rails 3 (beta) support
  should be improved for deployments lacking a config.ru

  There are more new integration tests, cleanups and some
  documentation improvements.

=== 0.990.0 / 2010-06-08 09:41 UTC

  Thanks to Augusto Becciu for finding a bug in the HTTP parser
  that caused a TypeError (and 500) when a rare client set the
  "Version:" header which conflicts with the HTTP_VERSION header
  we parse in the first line of the request[1].

  Horizontal tabs are now allowed as leading whitespace in header
  values as according to RFC 2616 as pointed out by
  IÃ±aki Baz Castillo[2].

  Taking a hint from Rack 1.1, the "logger" configuration
  parameter no longer requires a "close" method.  This means some
  more Logger replacements may be used.

  There's a new, optional, Unicorn (and maybe Passenger)-only
  middleware, Unicorn::OobGC[2] that runs GC outside of the normal
  request/response cycle to help out memory-hungry applications.
  Thanks to Luke Melia for being brave enough to test and report
  back on my big_app_gc.rb monkey patch[3] which lead up to this.

  Rails 3 (beta) support:

    Using "unicorn" is still recommended as Rails 3 comes with
    a config.ru, but "unicorn_rails" is cleaned up a bit and
    *should* work as well as "unicorn" out-of-the-box.  Feedback
    is much appreciated.

  Rubinius updates:

    USR2 binary upgrades are broken due to
    {TCPServer,UNIXServer}.for_fd[5][6] being broken
    (differently).

    Repeatedly hitting the server with signals in a tight
    loop is unusual and not recommended[7].

    There are some workarounds and general code cleanups for other
    issues[8], as well but things should generally work unless you
    need USR2 upgrades.  Feedback and reports would be greatly
    appreciated as usual.

  MRI support:

    All tests (except old Rails) run and pass under 1.9.2-preview3.
    1.8.7 and 1.9.1 work well as usual and will continue to be
    supported indefinitely.

  Lets hope this is the last release before 1.0.  Please report
  any issues on the mailing list[9] or email us privately[a].

=== 0.99.0 / 2010-05-06 19:32 UTC

  Starting with this release, we'll always load Rack up front at
  startup.

  Previously we had complicated ways to avoid loading Rack until
  after the application was loaded to allow the application to
  load an alternate version of Rack.  However this has proven too
  error-prone to be worth supporting even though Unicorn does not
  have strict requirements on currently released Rack versions.

  If an app requires a different version of Rack than what Unicorn
  would load by default, it is recommended they only install that
  version of Rack (and no others) since Unicorn does not have any
  strict requirements on currently released Rack versions.

  Rails 2.3.x users should be aware of this as those versions are
  not compatible with Rack 1.1.0.

  If it is not possible to only have one Rack version installed
  "globally", then they should either use Isolate or Bundler and
  install a private version of Unicorn along with their preferred
  version of Rack.  Users who install in this way are recommended
  to execute the isolated/bundled version of Unicorn, instead of
  what would normally be in $PATH.

  Feedback/tips to mailto:mongrel-unicorn@rubyforge.org from
  Isolate and Bundler users would be greatly appreciated.

=== 0.98.0 / 2010-05-05 00:53 UTC

  Deployments that suspend or hibernate servers should no longer
  have workers killed off (and restarted) upon resuming.

  For Linux users of {raindrops}[http://raindrops.bogomips.org/]
  (v0.2.0+) configuration is easier as raindrops can now
  automatically detect the active listeners on the server
  via the new Unicorn.listener_names singleton method.

  For the pedantic, chunked request bodies without trailers are no
  longer allowed to omit the final CRLF.  This shouldn't affect
  any real and RFC-compliant clients out there.  Chunked requests
  with trailers have always worked and continue to work the same
  way.

  The rest are mostly small internal cleanups and documentation
  fixes.  See the commit logs for full details.

=== 0.97.1 / 2010-04-19 21:00 UTC

  This release fixes a denial-of-service vector for derived
  servers exposed directly to untrusted clients.

  This bug does not affect most Unicorn deployments as Unicorn is
  only supported with trusted clients (such as nginx) on a LAN.
  nginx is known to reject clients that send invalid
  Content-Length headers, so any deployments on a trusted LAN
  and/or behind nginx are safe.

  Servers affected by this bug include (but are not limited to)
  Rainbows! and Zbatery.  This bug does not affect Thin nor
  Mongrel, as neither got the request body filtering treatment
  that the Unicorn HTTP parser got in August 2009.

  The bug fixed in this release could result in a
  denial-of-service as it would trigger a process-wide assertion
  instead of raising an exception.  For servers such as
  Rainbows!/Zbatery that serve multiple clients per worker
  process, this could abort all clients connected to the
  particular worker process that hit the assertion.

=== 0.97.0 / 2010-03-01 18:26 UTC

  A bunch of small fixes related to startup/configuration and hot
  reload issues with HUP:

  * Variables in the user-generated config.ru files no longer
    risk clobbering variables used in laucher scripts.

  * signal handlers are initialized before the pid file is
    dropped, so over-eager firing of init scripts won't
    mysteriously nuke a process.

  * SIGHUP will return app to original state if an updated
    config.ru fails to load due to {Syntax,Load}Error.

  * unicorn_rails should be Rails 3 compatible out-of-the-box
    ('unicorn' works as always, and is recommended for Rails 3)

  * unicorn_rails is finally "working_directory"-aware when
    generating default temporary paths and pid file

  * config.ru encoding is the application's default in 1.9,
    not forced to binary like many parts of Unicorn.

  * configurator learned to handle the "user" directive outside
    of after_fork hook (which will always remain supported).

  There are also various internal cleanups and possible speedups.

=== 0.96.1 / 2010-02-13 08:35 UTC

  This maintenance release is intended for users of Rainbows! and
  Zbatery servers (and anybody else using Unicorn::HttpParser).

  This memory leak DID NOT affect Unicorn itself: Unicorn always
  allocates the HttpParser once and always reuses it in every
  sequential request.

  This leak affects applications that repeatedly allocate a new
  HTTP parser.  Thus this bug affects _all_ deployments of
  Rainbows! and Zbatery.  These servers allocate a new parser for
  every client connection to serve clients concurrently.

  I misread the Data_Make_Struct()/Data_Wrap_Struct()
  documentation and ended up passing NULL as the "free" argument
  instead of -1, causing the memory to never be freed.

  From README.EXT in the MRI source which I misread:
  > The free argument is the function to free the pointer
  > allocation.  If this is -1, the pointer will be just freed.
  > The functions mark and free will be called from garbage
  > collector.

=== 0.96.0 / 2010-01-08 05:18 UTC

  This release includes small changes for things allowed by Rack
  1.1.  It is also now easier to detect if daemonized process
  fails to start.  Manpages received some minor updates as well.

  Rack 1.1 allowed us to make the following environment changes:

  * "rack.logger" is now set to the "logger" specified in
    the Unicorn config file.  This defaults to a Logger
    instance pointing to $stderr.

  * "rack.version" is now at [1,1].  Unicorn remains
    compatible with previous Rack versions if your app
    depends on it.

  While only specified since Rack 1.1, Unicorn has always exposed
  "rack.input" in binary mode (and has ridiculous integration
  tests that go outside of Ruby to prove it!).

=== 0.95.3 / 2009-12-21 21:51 UTC

  The HTTP parser now allows (but does not parse) the userinfo
  component in the very rare requests that send absoluteURIs.
  Thanks to Scott Chacon for reporting and submitting a test case
  for this fix.

  There are also minor documentation updates and tiny cleanups.

=== 0.95.2 / 2009-12-07 09:52 UTC

  Small fixes to our HTTP parser to allows semicolons in PATH_INFO
  as allowed by RFC 2396, section 3.3.  This is low impact for
  existing apps as semicolons are rarely seen in URIs.  Our HTTP
  parser runs properly under Rubinius 0.13.0 and 1.0.0-rc1 again
  (though not yet the rest of the server since we rely heavily on
  signals).

  Another round of small documentation tweaks and minor cleanups.

=== 0.95.1 / 2009-11-21 21:13 UTC

  Configuration files paths given on the command-line are no
  longer expanded.  This should make configuration reloads
  possible when a non-absolute path is specified for --config-file
  and Unicorn was deployed to a symlink directories (as with
  Capistrano).  Since deployments have always been strongly
  encouraged to use absolute paths in the config file, this
  change does not affect them.

  This is our first gem release using gemcutter.

  Eric Wong (3):
        SIGNALS: HUP + preload_app cannot reload app code
        Do not expand paths given on the shell
        GNUmakefile: prep release process for gemcutter

=== 0.95.0 / 2009-11-15 22:21 UTC

  Mostly internal cleanups and documentation updates.  Irrelevant
  stacktraces from client disconnects/errors while reading
  "rack.input" are now cleared to avoid unnecessary noise.  If
  user switching in workers is used, ownership of logs is now
  preserved when reopening worker logs (send USR1 only to the the
  master in this case).  The timeout config no longer affects long
  after_fork hooks or application startups.

  New features include the addition of the :umask option for the
  "listen" config directive and error reporting for non-portable
  socket options.

  No ponies have ever been harmed in our development.

=== 0.94.0 / 2009-11-05 09:52 UTC

  The HTTP parser is fix for oddly-aligned reads of trailers (this
  technically affects headers, too, but is highly unlikely due to
  our non-support of slow clients).  This allows our HTTP parser
  to better support very slow clients when used by other servers
  (like Rainbows!).  Fortunately this bug does not appear to lead
  to any invalid memory accesses (and potential arbitrary code
  execution).

  FreeBSD (and possibly other *BSDs) support is improved and and
  all the test cases pass under FreeBSD 7.2.  Various flavors of
  GNU/Linux remains our primary platform for development and
  production.

  New features added include the "working_directory" directive in
  the configurator .  Even without specifying a
  "working_directory", symlink-aware detection of the current path
  no longer depends on /bin/sh so it should work out-of-the-box on
  FreeBSD and Solaris and not just systems where /bin/sh is dash,
  ksh93 or bash.

  User-switching support is finally supported but only intended
  for use in the after_fork hook of worker processes.  Putting it
  in the after_fork hook allows allows users to set things like
  CPU affinity[1] on a per-worker basis before dropping
  privileges.  The master process retains all privileges it
  started with.

  The ENV["RACK_ENV"] (process-wide) environment variable is now
  both read and set for `unicorn' in the same way RAILS_ENV is
  used by `unicorn_rails'.  This allows the Merb launcher to read
  ENV["RACK_ENV"] in config.ru.  Other web servers already set
  this and there may be applications or libraries that already
  rely on this de facto standard.

=== 0.93.5 / 2009-10-29 21:41 UTC

  This release fixes a regression introduced in 0.93.3 where
  timed-out worker processes run a chance of not being killed off
  at all if they're hung.  While it's not ever advisable to have
  requests take a long time, we realize it's easy to fix
  everything :)

=== 0.93.4 / 2009-10-27 07:57 UTC

  This release mainly works around BSD stdio compatibility issues
  that affect at least FreeBSD and OS X.  While this issues was
  documented and fixed in [ruby-core:26300][1], no production
  release of MRI 1.8 has it, and users typically upgrade MRI more
  slowly than gems.  This issue does NOT affect 1.9 users.  Thanks
  to Vadim Spivak for reporting and testing this issue and Andrey
  Stikheev for the fix.

  Additionally there are small documentation bits, one error
  handling improvement, and one minor change that should improve
  reliability of signal delivery.

  This release fixes compatibility with OpenBSD (and possibly
  other Unices with stricter fchmod(2) implementations) thanks to
  Jeremy Evans.  Additionally there are small documentation
  changes all around.

        unicorn 0.93.3

=== 0.93.2 / 2009-10-07 08:45 UTC

  Avoid truncated POST bodies from with URL-encoded forms in Rails
  by switching TeeInput to use read-in-full semantics (only) when
  a Content-Length: header exists.  Chunked request bodies
  continue to exhibit readpartial semantics to support
  simultaneous bidirectional chunking.

  The lack of return value checking in Rails to protect against a
  short ios.read(length) is entirely reasonable even if not
  pedantically correct.  Most ios.read(length) implementations
  return the full amount requested except right before EOF.

  Also there are some minor documentation improvements.

        unicorn 0.93.2

=== 0.93.1 / 2009-10-03 01:17 UTC

  Fix permissions for release tarballs/gems, no other changes.
  Thanks to Jay Reitz for reporting this.

=== 0.93.0 / 2009-10-02 21:04 UTC

  The one minor bugfix is only for Rails 2.3.x+ users who set the
  RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT environment variable in a config file.
  Users of the "--path" switch or those who set the environment
  variable in the shell were unaffected by this bug.  Note that we
  still don't have relative URL root support for Rails < 2.3, and
  are unlikely to bother with it unless there is visible demand
  for it.

  New features includes support for :tries and :delay when
  specifying a "listen" in an after_fork hook.  This was inspired
  by Chris Wanstrath's example of binding per-worker listen
  sockets in a loop while migrating (or upgrading) Unicorn.
  Setting a negative value for :tries means we'll retry the listen
  indefinitely until the socket becomes available.

  So you can do something like this in an after_fork hook:

      after_fork do |server, worker|
        addr = "127.0.0.1:#{9293 + worker.nr}"
        server.listen(addr, :tries => -1, :delay => 5)
      end

  There's also the usual round of added documentation, packaging
  fixes, code cleanups, small fixes and minor performance
  improvements that are viewable in the "git log" output.

        unicorn 0.93.0

=== 0.92.0 / 2009-09-18 21:40 UTC

  Small fixes and documentation are the focus of this release.

  James Golick reported and helped me track down a bug that caused
  SIGHUP to drop the default listener (0.0.0.0:8080) if and only
  if listeners were completely unspecified in both the
  command-line and Unicorn config file.  The Unicorn config file
  remains the recommended option for specifying listeners as it
  allows fine-tuning of the :backlog, :rcvbuf, :sndbuf,
  :tcp_nopush, and :tcp_nodelay options.

  There are some documentation (and resulting website)
  improvements.  setup.rb users will notice the new section 1
  manpages for `unicorn` and `unicorn_rails`, Rubygems users
  will have to install manpages manually or use the website.

  The HTTP parser got a 3rd-party code review which resulted in
  some cleanups and one insignificant bugfix as a result.

  Additionally, the HTTP parser compiles, runs and passes unit
  tests under Rubinius.  The pure-Ruby parts still do not work yet
  and we currently lack the resources/interest to pursue this
  further but help will be gladly accepted.

  The website now has an Atom feed for new release announcements.
  Those unfamiliar with Atom or HTTP may finger unicorn@bogomips.org
  for the latest announcements.

  pass through unknown HTTP status codes

  This release allows graceful degradation in case a user is using a
  status code not defined by Rack::Utils::HTTP_STATUS_CODES.  A patch has
  been submitted[1] upstream to Rack but this issue may still affect users
  of yet-to-be-standardized status codes.

  socket handling bugfixes and usability tweaks

  Socket handling bugfixes and socket-related usability and
  performance tweaks.  We no longer trust FD_CLOEXEC to be
  inherited across accept(); thanks to Paul Sponagl for diagnosing
  this issue on OSX.  There are also minor tweaks backported from
  0.9.0 to make non-graceful restarts/upgrades go more smoothly.

  Eric Wong (6):
        Unbind listeners as before stopping workers
        Retry listen() on EADDRINUSE 5 times every 500ms
        Re-add support for non-portable socket options
        Minor cleanups to core
        always set FD_CLOEXEC on sockets post-accept()
        unicorn 0.8.2

=== 0.9.1 / 2009-07-09 08:49 UTC

  FD_CLOEXEC portability fix (v0.8.2 port)

  Minor cleanups, set FD_CLOEXEC on accepted listen sockets
  instead of relying on the flag to be inherited across accept.

  The 0.9.x series (including this release) is NOT recommended for
  production use, try 0.8.x instead.

  bodies: "Transfer-Encoding: chunked", rewindable streaming

  We now have support for "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" bodies in
  requests.  Not only that, Rack applications reading input bodies
  get that data streamed off to the client socket on an as-needed
  basis.  This allows the application to do things like upload
  progress notification and even tunneling of arbitrary stream
  protocols via bidirectional chunked encoding.

  See Unicorn::App::Inetd and examples/git.ru (including the
  comments) for an example of tunneling the git:// protocol over
  HTTP.

  This release also gives applications the ability to respond
  positively to "Expect: 100-continue" headers before being rerun
  without closing the socket connection.  See Unicorn::App::Inetd
  for an example of how this is used.

  This release is NOT recommended for production use.

  {after,before}_fork API change, small tweaks/fixes

  * There is an API change in the {after,before}_fork hooks
    so now the entire Worker struct is exposed to the user.
    This allows Unicorn to unofficially support user/group
    privilege changing.

  * The "X-Forwarded-Proto:" header can be set by proxies
    to ensure rack.url_scheme is "https" for SSL-enabled
    sites.

  * Small cleanups and tweaks throughout, see shortlog (below)
    or changelog for details.
